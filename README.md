# Thesis Evaluation Tool

A web-based application for evaluating academic theses using predefined text modules and weighted scoring criteria. This tool helps evaluators assess theses across four main categories: Preface, Form, Structure, and Content, ultimately providing a grade recommendation based on weighted selections.

Access through GitHub pages: [https://marloto.github.io/evaluation-app/](https://marloto.github.io/evaluation-app/)

## Note

This overall project was created using Claude, an AI assistant developed by Anthropic. The offset was an example evaluation text as well as a set of criterions within a text document. The assistant was asked to create an app in order to help with rating. After more than 42 separated chats, this is the current result. I've never created a React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS project before, but have experiences with webdevelopment and even Angular, Vue or Svelte. This was basically an experiment in order so see where we get here. To be fair, even this README is mostly generated by the assistent.

- Providers: The `ConfigProvider`, `EvaluationStateProvider`, and `GradeProvider` manage the application's state and configuration.
- Main Components: The `MainSplitView` is the main entry point, which connects the various components like `ConfigurationSidebar`, `EvaluationNavigation`, `Criterion`, `OptionList`, `SectionList`, and `RichTextEditor`.
- Sidebar Components: The `ConfigurationSidebar` allows users to manage the application's configuration, including sections, criteria, and grade settings.
- Navigation Components: The `EvaluationNavigation` component provides an overview of the evaluation progress and access to various analysis tools.
- Editing Components: The `SectionItem`, `CriterionItem`, and `OptionEditDialog` components handle the creation, editing, and deletion of sections, criteria, and options.
- Dialog Components: The application includes various dialog components, such as `AnalyticsDialog`, `CriteriaOverview`, `NotesDialog`, and others, which provide additional functionality.
- Utility Components: The `Criterion`, `OptionList`, and `RichTextEditor` components provide specific functionality for the application.
